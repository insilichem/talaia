# How to install TALAIA for UCSF Chimera

Intalling TALAIA in UCSF Chimera is very easy and quick. You will need to follow these steps:

1. You need UCSF Chimera installed if not download it from https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html. 
If it is your first time using UCSF Chimera you can find information here: https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Outreach/Tutorials/GettingStarted.html. There is also plenty of tutorials. Beware, that TALAIA has been developed under UCSF Chimera (which stands on Python 2). Deployments for ChimeraX (Python 3) are not yet finalized.

2. Download TALAIA from the insilichem's Github repository. You can either clone it or download it as ZIP.

5. As TALAIA only works through command line, you will need to activate it if it does not appear at the bottom of the Chimera window. In order to do so you have to go to Favorites -> Command line.
